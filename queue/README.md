# Queue

Queue is an abstract data structure, similar to stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology.

Queue operations may involve initializing or defining the queue, utilizing it, and then completely reoving it from the memory.
